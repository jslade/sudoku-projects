Purpose
=======

This project is a collection of sudoku-related projects based on multiple languages and platforms. The main purpose is for me to practice / learn these various technologies, using something that is easily understood but has some possible complexities.

The main focus is to create a number of sudoku puzzle 'solvers' that are capable of generating, solving, and checking basic 9x9 sudoku puzzles; and a number of sudoku puzzle 'frontends' that can display puzzles, including animating progress of the associated solvers, and allowing human interaction.

Along with practicing development with various technologies, I expect these projects will demonstrate my technical abilities as a sort of portfolio.
